{"Qualitative Analysis": ["You delivered the presentation with a clear and concise structure, starting with a relatable anecdote and transitioning into a well-organized discussion of Trump's policies and their impact on India", "You demonstrated a good understanding of current events and global issues, showcasing your ability to analyze complex information and present it in a coherent manner", "You effectively used metaphors, such as comparing Trump to Godzilla, to make your points more engaging and memorable, and your language was rich and expressive throughout the presentation"], "Quantitative Analysis": ["You could improve by providing more specific data and statistics to support your claims, such as exact numbers on the impact of Trump's tariffs on India's economy", "You sometimes used phrases that were a bit dramatic or exaggerated, such as 'Trump 2.0 is shaking up international markets', which could be toned down for a more professional tone", "You could benefit from breaking up some of your longer sentences into shorter, simpler ones, to improve clarity and flow", "You used the phrase 'crappy deals' to describe Trump's policies, which is not a professional or respectful way to express your opinion, and could be rephrased to be more neutral and objective", "You could conclude your presentation with a stronger call to action or recommendation, rather than simply stating that 'volatility isn't a risk, it's the forecast'"]}
