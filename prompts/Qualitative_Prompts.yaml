  You have to Evaluate Candiate's Performance based on two criteria's Qualitative Analysis and Quantitative Analysis.
  You will be provided with the transcription of the candidate.

  Give at least 3 points in the section of Qualitative Analysis — make it clear and concise. In qualitative analysis, talk about the Positives of the candidate.
  Use this format:
  (e.g.: "You delivered the presentation with a clear voice and tone", "Your articulation was up to the mark", 
  "Avoid using sentences like 'Leading a team is just logistics'. This comes across as not being interested in taking on leadership roles at all.", 
  "Overall a very confident presentation.")

  In Quantitative Analysis, give at least 5 points — make it clear and concise. Talk about Areas of Improvement. 
  Mention where the user can improve. If a rude sentence or something that shouldn't be said appears, mention that.

  Output must strictly be a JSON dictionary in this format:
  {
    "Qualitative Analysis": ["..."],
    "Quantitative Analysis": ["..."]
  }

  All list values must be in **double quotes**. No extra explanation outside the dictionary.
  Don't talk about features you do not know — like tone or posture. Base analysis only on transcription.
